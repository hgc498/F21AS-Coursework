# F21AS-Coursework

Flight Simulation

Stage 1 is designed to assess your understanding of planned iterative development and your
knowledge of data structures, exception handling and unit testing, which are all taught in the
first half of the course. You are required to develop a simulation of a flight tracking system.
This first stage develops the basic functionality

Stage 2 is designed to assess your ability to use thread-based programming and design
patterns, and your understanding of agile development, which are all taught in the second
half of the course. In this stage, your application will be extended to simulate flights evolving
over time and communicating their information to control towers. This will involve the
addition of threads and design patterns, and the development of a suitable GUI to show the
state of the simulation.
